# Two text functions mirroring `textContent` / `innerText`, not one mode option

> **Amended 2026-10-09** (GitHub issue #41), after a closer reading of the [`innerText` algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-innertext-idl-attribute). A top element (the input, a document's root element, or a top-level element of a list) whose role is `Skip` gives its whole text content, trimmed at both ends, as the getter does for an element that is not being rendered. This holds whether the role comes from the frozen table or a `"Roles"` rule, which stands in for the page's CSS. A `Skip` element below the top is dropped as before. The frozen table now holds the whole of §15.3.1's `display: none` list (adding `area`, `basefont`, `noembed`, `noframes`, `param`, `rp`), and `textarea` is `Skip`, not `Preformatted`, since its content has no CSS box. Whitespace collapse covers HTML whitespace only, so a no-break space is kept, and each `<br>` gives its own newline. Everything else stands; "paragraph-aware spacing" below is GitHub issue #44.

## Context

`HTMLText` (through v1.0.2) concatenates a tree's descendant strings verbatim: lossless, no whitespace collapse, no block breaks, `<br>` ignored. Callers almost always then normalize it (the recurring `norm`/`plain` boilerplate), which raised the question of whether "readable" text should be the default or an option on a single function.

## Decision

Ship **two** functions, not one function with a whitespace mode:

- **`HTMLTextContent`** — the raw, lossless tree-fold (a rename of `HTMLText`).
- **`HTMLInnerText`** — readable text: collapses whitespace, breaks block-level tags onto their own lines, maps `<br>` → newline, preserves `<pre>` verbatim, drops non-rendered tags (`script`, `style`, …), and trims the result.

`HTMLText` is renamed to `HTMLTextContent` cleanly (no alias). The names and the split are inherited from the web platform's two long-standing answers to "what is the text of this HTML?": DOM `textContent` (a `Node` tree-fold) and `innerText` (an `HTMLElement` rendering projection).

`HTMLInnerText` classifies each element **by tag alone** into one of five roles (`Block`, `Inline`, `Preformatted`, `LineBreak`, `Skip`) using a frozen transcription of the WHATWG HTML §15 default user-agent stylesheet. It never reads CSS — not classes, not `<style>`, not even inline `style=`. Users override the classification with the `"Roles"` option: an ordered list of `XMLPattern -> role` rules (bare string sugars to `XMLPattern[string]`), tried first-match-wins, falling back to the frozen table, with unmatched tags defaulting to `Inline`. Block boundaries are joined by the `"BlockSeparator"` option (default `"\n"`).

## Considered options

- **One function, `"Whitespace" -> "Collapse" | "Trim" | "Preserve"` (Option A).** Rejected: the two behaviors have _conflicting defaults_. The raw primitive's honest default is lossless; the readable function's whole value is that normalization is the default (killing the `plain` boilerplate). One symbol cannot satisfy both, and the readable function's option surface (`"Roles"`, `"BlockSeparator"`) is inert in raw mode — half-dead options on a primitive.
- **A `Function[el, …]` classifier override.** Rejected: a pattern LHS plus `RuleDelayed`/`Condition`/`PatternTest` subsumes it declaratively, reusing the paclet's own `XMLPattern`/`CSSClass` machinery — no second DSL.
- **CSS-style specificity for rule conflicts.** Rejected: reimplements the cascade we are explicitly avoiding. First-match-by-order is predictable and is the language's own `Replace` convention.
- **Honoring inline `style=`.** Rejected: we can see inline `display:none` but not the class-based equivalent, so honoring it makes behavior hinge on an invisible authoring accident. Tags-only is predictable.

## Consequences

- `HTMLInnerText` approximates `innerText`'s _non-rendered_ fallback regime permanently (no layout engine), so it reproduces HTML-under-default-UA-styles, not this-page-as-rendered. A page that restyles a tag's `display` will not move it. Docs must say so plainly.
- `HTMLText` callers must migrate to `HTMLTextContent` (cheap at v1.0.2; the only in-repo caller is `html-to-markdown.wls`).
- `HTMLTextContent` also gains the bug fix that `HTMLText` silently returned `""` for a whole `XMLObject["Document"]`, plus a bad-argument message — aligning its input contract with `XMLCases`/`XMLFirstCase`.
- Paragraph-aware spacing (mixed per-tag break counts), true CSS-cascade hiding, and `ToMarkdown` are explicitly _out of scope_ and left to a future structural transform, which would share this block/`<pre>` classification.
